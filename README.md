## Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This project presents an **interactive Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI**. The dashboard is designed to analyze customer behavior, identify churn patterns, and support data-driven decision-making by visualizing key customer and service-related attributes.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation (Power Query)

Before building the dashboard, extensive **data cleaning and transformation** were performed using **Power Query** to ensure data quality and consistency. The preparation process included:

* Removing duplicate and unnecessary records
* Handling missing and null values
* Standardizing column names and data types
* Converting numerical and categorical fields into appropriate formats
* Creating new calculated columns to support churn analysis
* Ensuring consistency in values such as contract types, payment methods, and customer status

These steps ensured that the dataset was accurate, well-structured, and optimized for analysis and visualization.

## Dashboard Visualizations

The dashboard includes multiple charts and KPIs to provide a comprehensive view of customer churn:

* **Total Customers vs Churned Customers**
  Displays the overall customer base and highlights the churn rate.

* **Churn by Contract Type**
  Visualizes how churn varies across monthly, yearly, and long-term contracts.

* **Churn by Payment Method**
  Shows the relationship between payment methods and customer churn behavior.

* **Churn by Internet and Service Usage**
  Analyzes churn trends based on services such as internet type, streaming, and add-ons.

* **Customer Demographics Analysis**
  Examines churn based on gender, senior citizen status, and tenure.

* **Tenure vs Churn**
  Illustrates how customer retention changes over time.

Each visualization is interactive, allowing users to filter and explore the data dynamically.
